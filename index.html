			<h1> You Have To Love Someone Without Fear‬ </h1>
			<p> You have to love someone without fear. You have to trust in things you can not always see. 
			Sometimes you have to walk with a blindfold on. You will not always know where you’re going. 
			There is never a guarantee.‬
‪			When we love, there is always the risk of a bruised heart. Egos take a few steps back. 
			Loving someone requires belief in the unbelievable. It requires leaping without looking. 
			It means being scared, but going for it anyway. It means knowing things might not work out, but giving it a shot.‬
‪		  	<p> You have to love someone without fear. 
			You have to find the courage to open yourself up to another human being. 
			You need to learn to be okay with vulnerability. Does not mean it is easy. Does not mean the nerves will not find you. 
			But fear will hold you back from fully loving, and from being fully loved.‬
‪			There is an entire world waiting for you. There is a universe that exists just for you and another person. 
			Exploration means bravery. It means taking a dive. It means holding out your hands and hoping someone will grab onto them. 
			Love means hoping someone is going to catch you. Love is thinking they will. Love is giving it a damn chance.‬
‪			<p> Maybe you will be hurt. Maybe they will be days when your walls are thicker than the desire to let someone in. 
			I understand. Letting someone see you is frightening. Letting someone love you, love every single piece of you is daunting.‬
			There is a quote widely attributed to Eleanor Roosevelt that says, “Do one thing every day that scares you.”‬
			‪Let that thing be love.‬
‪			<p> You have to love someone without fear, even if it is there in the beginning. 
			It is okay to be afraid, but do not let that close you off. 
			Do not let fear dictate what you do, or who you love, or how you love.‬
‪			The hardest things to do often become things we are forever grateful for. Love is no exception.‬
			‪Love someone without fear. Even if it is the scariest thing you will ever do.

				<h1> I want us to last a lifetime </h1>
			<p> Every people dreams of happily ever after, well there is no such thing as just pure happiness. 
			There will come a time where all the happiness might be hard to find during the relationship. 
			But guess what? How can you make your love the last one? 
			The love that will be with you all throughout your lifetime?
			The answer is very easy, but is hard to achieve. 
			Every waking day choose your love, their is no such thing as perfect relationship. 
			If you want it to last, never give up. Despite of all the problems and challenges that you might face. 
			Do not give up. If you feel that this is the love that you want for a lifetime. 
			If you get tired of the relationship, just rest but do not give up. Loving is also a choice.
			A choice of staying, or of giving up. 
			Wanting this love to last is by choosing to stay each and everyday until you are both gray and old.
			To the person I am with today, I want us to last a lifetime.
